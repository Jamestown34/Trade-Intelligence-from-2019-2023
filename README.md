## 📌 Introduction

### 💡 Project Description

Global trade is essential to economic development, especially for resource-dependent countries like Nigeria. This project explores **Nigeria's import trends** over a 5-year period to uncover insights that inform business strategy, supply chain planning, and national trade policy.

> **🧠 Business Problem:**  
> "How can Nigeria optimize its trade partnerships by identifying key sources, dependencies, and patterns from historical import data?"

## 📊 The Data

Sourced from [ITC-style export partner data], this dataset contains:

- Exporting country  
- Nigeria’s import value from each country  
- Yearly values from **2019 to 2023**

Values are in USD thousands and represent the total import value by year.

## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed

### 1️⃣ Import Dependency  
Identified which countries Nigeria relies on the most by computing each country’s share of total imports.

### 2️⃣ Volatility Analysis  
Calculated standard deviation across years to flag partners with unstable trade volumes.

### 3️⃣ Import Growth Trends  
Computed year-over-year percentage growth and average 5-year growth per country.

### 4️⃣ Top Contributors  
Ranked countries by total imports to find Nigeria's biggest suppliers.

### 5️⃣ Trade Concentration (HHI)  
Used Herfindahl-Hirschman Index to quantify how concentrated Nigeria’s import sources are.

### 6️⃣ COVID-19 Impact  
Compared pre-pandemic (2019) vs post-pandemic (2020–2021) to highlight disruptions or resilience.

### 7️⃣ Declining Partners  
Highlighted countries with consistently shrinking export value to Nigeria.

### 8️⃣ Fastest Growing Partners  
Identified countries with strong positive trends in trade growth post-2021.
